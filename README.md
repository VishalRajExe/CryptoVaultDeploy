## ⏳ Interactive Market Replay Mode (Backtesting Sandbox)

The **Market Replay Mode** is a powerful fintech feature that allows traders to backtest strategies using historical candle data. It swaps the application data source from live markets to an isolated, simulated environment.

### Key Capabilities:
- **Flexible Configurations:** Create sessions for any supported trading pair (e.g., BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT), timeframe (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 1d), starting date, and custom virtual starting balance.
- **Interactive Player Controls:** 
  - **Auto-Play / Pause / Resume:** Automatically advance candles over time with a reactive scheduler.
  - **Adjustable Speeds:** Speed up or slow down replay rates (0.5x, 1x, 2x, 5x).
  - **Manual Navigation:** Step forward or backward candle-by-candle for precise chart analysis.
- **Isolated Virtual Trading Engine:** Place virtual MARKET orders that execute against the historical candle's closing price. The system automatically computes weighted average purchase costs, updates holding balances, and validates quote/base currency constraints.
- **Resilient Seed Fallback:** Automatically fetches up to 1,000 candles from the public Binance API. In case of unsupported pairs or API rate limits, a **synthetic candle engine** takes over, generating realistic price wicks and wiggles to keep the chart functional.
- **Performance & Equity Analytics:** Track trades in real-time. Selling assets logs trades to compute win rates, ROI, average risk-to-reward ratios, and plot an equity curve with maximum drawdown.
- **Safe Persistence:** Session parameters, current playback times, wallets, orders, and trade histories are fully persisted in the MySQL database, enabling users to stop, delete, or resume sessions later.

## 🔐 Security & Data Integrity

CryptoVault is engineered with production-ready security practices adhering to **OWASP Top 10** recommendations.

- **Backend Security Hardening:** SQL Injection Prevention, Secure Authentication Filters, Protected REST APIs, Token Expiration, Request Sanitization.
- **Comprehensive DTO & Financial Validation:** Strict server-side validation using Jakarta Bean Validation (`@NotBlank`, `@Positive`, etc.) combined with regex and business rule validation for all financial data (Bank details, Wallet IDs, Trading quantities).
- **Transaction Integrity:** Database consistency and race condition prevention ensured via `@Transactional` operations for all trading, wallet transfers, and deposits/withdrawals.
- **Rate Limiting:** Strategic rate limiting implemented on sensitive endpoints (Login, Trading APIs, AI Chatbot) to prevent abuse.
- **Global Exception Handling:** Centralized `@ControllerAdvice` handling for validation, authentication, and financial exceptions with standardized API error responses.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to get both the backend and frontend running locally.

### 1. Backend Setup

**Prerequisites:** Java 17, MySQL Server, Maven (or included `mvnw` wrapper)

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd Backend
   ```
2. Configure the database:
   - Default configuration is in `Backend/src/main/resources/application.properties`.
   - Ensure a MySQL instance is running on `localhost:3306` with user `root` and password `admin` (or override via environment variables like `DB_URL`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`).
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```
   The backend will start on **http://localhost:5454**.

### 2. Frontend Setup

**Prerequisites:** Node.js (v18+), npm

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd f2
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Environment Configuration:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Start the Vite development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will be accessible at **http://localhost:5173**.
