/**
 * A single activity-feed entry: "who did what". Created automatically by the

 * withdraws, places an order, transfers funds, etc) and surfaced two ways:
 *   - GET /api/notifications        - the current user's own notification bell
 *   - GET /api/admin/activity       - every notification across all users, for
 *                                      the admin "full activity" tab
 *
 * NOTE: this was previously a plain @Data POJO with no @Entity annotation and no
 * repository - it was defined but never actually used or persisted anywhere.
